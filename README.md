So this app is basically a diary/music app.

It also has an instagram viewy thing

I'm very aware that there is no design, and a fair amount of poor practice. The point of this is to run it locally and use it yourself, not to deploy it. So I don't want to hear shit about how I'm using sha1() instead of properly salting my passwords.

This app was originally made because I am quite a young lad and had/have an obsession over this girl and was always too much of a pussy to talk to her. Anyway that was the catalyst for this so shoutouts to her I guess.
